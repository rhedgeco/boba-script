# boba-script

`boba-script` is a general purpose interpreted programming language intended to be used with another one of my projects `boba-engine`. While it does not contain any code that references the engine, its internals are built in a way that allows it to be transformed into a domain specific language for that purpose. This means that it does not have to be a DSL for `boba-engine` specifically, but it can be used as a general purpose language or transformed into a DSL for another purpose.
